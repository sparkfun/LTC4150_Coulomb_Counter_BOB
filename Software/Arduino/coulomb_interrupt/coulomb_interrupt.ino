/* LTC4150 Coulomb Counter interrupt example code

This sketch shows how to use the LTC4150 Coulomb Counter breakout
board along with interrupts to implement a battery "gas gauge."

HOW IT WORKS:

Battery capacity is measured in amp-hours (Ah). For example, a one
amp-hour battery can provide 1 amp of current for one hour, or 2 amps
for half an hour, or half an amp for two hours, etc.

The LTC4150 monitors current passing into or out of a battery.
It has an output called INT (interrupt) that will pulse low every
time 0.0001707 amp-hours passes through the part. Or to put it
another way, the INT signal will pulse 5859 times for one amp-hour.

If you hook up a full 1Ah (1000mAh) battery to the LTC4150, you
can expect to get 5859 pulses before it's depleted. If you keep track
of these pulses, you can accurately determine the remaining battery
capacity.

There is also a POL (polarity) signal coming out of the LTC4150.
When you detect a pulse, you can check the POL signal to see whether
current is moving into or out of the battery. If POL is low, current is
coming out of the battery (discharging). If POL is high, current is
going into the battery (charging).

(Note that because of chemical inefficiencies, it takes a bit more current
to charge a battery than you will eventually get out of it. This sketch
does not take this into account. For better accuracy you might provide
a method to "zero" a full battery, either automatically or manually.)

Although it isn't the primary function of the part, you can also
measure the time between pulses to calculate current draw. At 1A
(the maximum allowed), INT will pulse every 0.6144 seconds, or
1.6275 Hz. Note that for low currents, pulses will be many seconds
apart, so don't expect frequent updates.

There are two methods you can use to keep track of the INT pulses. You
can use an interrupt input to monitor the INT signal in the background,
or you can monitor the INT line yourself and use the CLR signal to reset
the LTC4150 for the next pulse.

** This sketch shows how to use interrupts with the LTC4150. **

HARDWARE CONNECTIONS:

Before connecting this board to your Arduino, double check that
all three solder jumpers are set appropriately:

For this sketch, leave SJ1 soldered (closed).
This connects INT and CLR to clear interrupts automatically.

If you're using a 5V Arduino, leave both SJ2 and SJ3 open (unsoldered).

If you're using a 3.3V Arduino, close (solder) both SJ2 and SJ3.

Connect the following pins to your Arduino:

VIO to VCC
GND to GND
INT to D3
POL to D4

Note that if you solder headers to the bottom of the breakout board,
you can plug it directly into Arduino header pins D2 (VIO) through
D7 (SHDN).

RUNNING THE SKETCH:

This sketch monitors current moving into and out of a battery.
Whenever it detects a low INT signal from the LTC4150, it will
update the battery state-of-charge (how full the battery is),
current draw, etc.

The sketch is hardcoded for a 2000mAh battery that is 100% full
when the sketch starts. You can easily change this by editing
line 120 and 121:

  volatile double battery_mAh = 2000.0; // milliamp-hours (mAh)
  volatile double battery_percent = 100.0;  // state-of-charge (percent)

After uploading the sketch, open the Serial Monitor and set the
baud rate to 9600. Whenever the sketch detects an INT pulse, it
will update its calculations and print them out.
